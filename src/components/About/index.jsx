    <Text>
    I am a Computer Science student with 4 years of experience in multinational companies, 
    focusing on technical support and infrastructure since 2021. Currently, I work directly 
    with programming in the automation sector, where I am responsible for creating websites 
    using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and other technologies. I also develop applications, automation 
    flows, lists, and libraries through the Power Platform, utilizing technologies such as Power
     Apps, Power Automate, and Office 365 tools, as well as managing SharePoint flows and pages.
      I have a strong passion for technology and development, especially in the area of web development. 
      I possess skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ReactJS, Svelte, Figma and Python. Additionally, 
      I am actively learning and expanding my knowledge in popular frameworks and libraries like 
      Angular and ReactJS. I am known for being quick, a fast and consistent learner, always motivated 
      to overcome obstacles and embrace new challenges.
