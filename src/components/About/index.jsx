    <Text>
I'm a Computer Science student with 4 years of experience in multinational companies. 
I began my professional journey in 2021 focusing on technical support and infrastructure, 
but I currently work in development, with a strong emphasis on automation and web development.
 Iâ€™m responsible for building websites using technologies like ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. 
 I also develop applications, automation flows, lists, and libraries using the Power Platform 
 such as Power Apps, Power Automate, and Office 365 tools and manage SharePoint pages and workflows.
  I'm passionate about technology and software development, especially in the web environment. 
  I'm constantly learning and improving my development skills. I'm known for being fast, a quick 
  and consistent learner, always motivated to overcome obstacles and embrace new challenges.
